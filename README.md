 5. **Create an Event**  
Easily host an event by navigating to "My Events" and clicking "Create Event." Here, you can choose to create either a public or private event. Public events are listed on "Explore Events" for anyone to view and join, while private events remain unlisted and can only be accessed by sharing the event URL with your target audience. While event attendees can purchase tickets with any supported chain of their choice, event hosts are given the option of choosing the blockchain network they would like to receive their money. All funds are converted to the hosts choice of blockchain with the help of Klaster account abstraction.
